An organisation is running a campaign on gender pay inequality in the university sector. You have been employed to help with their campaign. You have been asked examine the data from UK Government’s Gender pay gap service and present your findings. For the purpose of this exercise, your analysis should be impartial: you will simply present whatever conclusions you think can be drawn from the data, regardless of whether they would support the campaign or not.

You will be given an additional data file universities.csv which lists the universities’ names (using the same names as those used in the Gender pay gap service data), together with their designation as “post-92” or “pre-92”. (“Post-92” refers to former polytechnics that were given university status in 1992. For example, The University of Sheffield is a “pre-92” university, and Sheffield Hallam University is a “post-92” university. “Post-92” universities tend to specialise more in vocational degrees.)
